				<hr>
				<p style="text-align: right;">
					When Andy started weight training 19 years ago it was never to be a bodybuilder;
					sure he was always into sports at school back in High School, soccer, American
					football, track and field, but he was the skinny kid! He just wanted to gain a
					little weight and size to help with his performance on the field, so his coach
					encouraged him to lift; and the rest they say is history.
				</p>
				<p style="text-align: right;">
					His mentality is very much to stay dedicated to a goal and, if he want something, he will see it
					through to the end.
					The gym soon became his passion, and along with a new group of friends they decided to enter a local
					bodybuilding competition; just for fun to keep them motivated, to train harder, and diet more. Long
					story short, he won! This was so cool especially when he was just a novice and a teenager. Competing
					quickly became his motivation to keep training, keep getting better, so he set a goal to stand on
					stage every year. He travelled all over the world winning countless shows and over 19 trophies over
					his 12 years of competing, including 1 time MuscleMania Pro World Champion and 4 time MuscleMania
					SuperBody Champion.
