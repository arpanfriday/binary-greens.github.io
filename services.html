                                monotonous, there’s no fresh air or sunshine, and if you slog through the same workout
                                every time, the tedium is real.
                            </p>
                            <p>But in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, you might be relegated to your basement
                                treadmill more often than you’d like if you haven’t been able to find an outdoor route
                                that isn’t overcrowded.
                            </p>
                            <p>Plus, with the right plan, a treadmill workout can offer much-needed variety and even a

                            <h2>Meditation</h2>
                            <p>Meditation isn’t about becoming a different person, a new person, or even a better
                                person. It’s about training in awareness and getting a healthy sense of perspective.
                                You’re not trying to turn off your thoughts or feelings. You’re learnin to observe them
                                without judgment. And eventually, you may start to better understand them as well.
                            </p>
                            <p>Mindfulness is the ability to be present, to rest in the here and now, fully engaged with
                                whatever we’re doing in the moment.
                            </p>
                            <p>Learning to meditate is like learning any other skill. Think of it like exercising a
                                muscle that you’ve never really worked out before. It takes consistent practice to get
                                comfortable. And it’s usually easier if you have a teacher. We’ve got you covered there.

                            <h2>Pull-Ups</h2>
                            <p>A pull-up is an upper-body strength exercise. The pull-up is a closed-chain movement
                                where the body is suspended by the hands and pulls up. As this happens, the elbows flex
                                and the shoulders adduct and extend to bring the elbows to the torso.
                            </p>
                            <p>The term chin-up, traditionally referring to a pull-up with the chin brought over the top
                                of a bar, was used in the 1980s to refer to a pronated, or overhand, grip, with a
                                supinated, or underhand, grip being called a "reverse-grip" chin-up. In
                                later decades, this usage has inverted, with some using "chin-up" to refer to a pull-up
                                done with a supinated hand position, while "pull-up" refers specifically to the
                                exercise done with a pronated hand position.
                            </p>
                            <p>Pull-ups use many different muscles of the upper body, including the latissimus dorsi and
                                the biceps brachii.

                            <h2>Yoga</h2>
                            <p>The practice of yoga has been thought to date back to pre-vedic Indian traditions;
                                possibly in the Indus valley civilization around 3000 BCE. Yoga is mentioned in the
                                Rigveda, and also referenced in the Upanishads.Although, yoga most
                                likely developed as a systematic study around the 5th and 6th centuries BCE, in ancient
                                India's ascetic and Śramaṇa movements.
                            </p>
                            <p>Yoga gurus from India later introduced yoga to the West, following the success of
                                Swami Vivekananda in the late 19th and early 20th century with his adaptation of yoga
                                tradition, excluding asanas. Outside India, it has developed into a posture-based
                                physical fitness, stress-relief and relaxation technique

                            <p>Whether you’re aiming for rapid fat loss, bulging muscles or cardiovascular fitness, a
                                pair of dumbbells will tick any box – providing you use them correctly. But
                                weightlifting with dumbbells can do more than just improve your immediate fitness
                                profile, and it may even save your life. Scientists working at Iowa State University
                                reported that lifting weights for less than an hour a week may reduce your risk of
                                suffering a heart attack or stroke by 40 to 70%.
                            </p>
                            <p>So you can reap the benefits of a good dumbbell sesh, we've teamed up with PT Ollie Frost

                            <h2>Gym Ball </h2>
                            <p>Want to know the secret for strengthening your core, protecting your joints, and getting
                                more muscle-building benefits out of every workout? It’s stability. Or, a stability
                                ball, to be exact. Also referred to as an exercise ball or a balance ball, stability
                                ball exercises can take your workouts to the next level.
                            </p>
                            <p>“Stability ball workouts help to teach the body to move as one unit,” explains Openfit
                                fitness specialist Cody Braun. “When performing stability ball exercises, the muscles
                                that make up the core and surround the hips and shoulders have to work together to keep
                                the body strong through a full range of motion.”
                            </p>
                            <p>Increased stability is useful for many reasons, both in and out of the gym. Stable joints
                                are less prone to injury, because they have the strength to stay in the correct position
                                during taxing movements. Additionally, being able to move your body as one cohesive unit
                                helps when it comes to weightlifting, running, and other athletic endeavors, Braun says.
